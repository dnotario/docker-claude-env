# User Configuration
# The container runs as a non-root user for security
# By default: USERNAME=dev, USER_UID=1000, USER_GID=1000
#
# IMPORTANT: For best file permission handling with mounted volumes,
# match these values to your host user's UID/GID:
#   Linux/Mac: Run `id` to see your UID and GID
#   Then set USER_UID and USER_GID to match
#
# Example: If your host user has UID=1001, GID=1001:
# USERNAME=myuser
# USER_UID=1001
# USER_GID=1001

# Optional: Add any project-specific environment variables below
# Example:
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb
# REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
# API_KEY=your_api_key_here
